# khawsar
Can you name the original 151, but are ashamed that you wouldn't know a Garchomp from a Bronzong?  Khawsar is here to help.

*(pronounced something like: Koau-saa')*

# What is it?
Khawsar is a simple open source pattern matching game with social messaging capabilities built using Google's design principles for mobile first material-design.  The player gets shown a random pokemon from amongst the 807 (via the Pokemon API).

Guess right?  Congrats!  Your correct guess is saved?

Guess wrong?  That's ok, you've got options.
 1) "run away" and "start a new encounter"
 2) use the built in Twilio API interface to copy over the Pokemon sprite (image) and text that one friend for help
